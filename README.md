# Obsidian BasesBuilder

A web application for generating [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax) queries through a simple chat-like interface. Part of **Lean Obsidian Studio**.

## What it does

BasesBuilder helps you create `.base` files for the Obsidian Bases core plugin without writing YAML by hand. Describe what you want in plain text, pick a starter template, and get a valid Base query you can copy or download straight into your vault.

## Features
- **6 starter templates** — Project Progress Bar, Star Ratings Table, Travel Trip Map, Birthday Tracker, Vault Cleaner, Content Summary
- **Keyword-based generation** — type a description and the app matches it to the best template (tasks, reading lists, daily notes, and more)
- **Fallback generator** — extracts tags, folders, and view types from free-form text to build a minimal Base when no template matches
- **Copy & Download** — one-click clipboard copy or download as a `.base` file
- **Modify flow** — after generating, the interface switches to an update mode so you can iterate on your query
- **Reset** — return to a clean slate at any time

## Getting started
Go to [LeanObsidianStudio](https://leanstudio.sascha-kasper.com/) and create the Bases you want.

## Tech stack
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no bundler
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font via Google Fonts
- Dark UI with cyan accent palette
